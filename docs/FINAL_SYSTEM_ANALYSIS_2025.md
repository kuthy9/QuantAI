### Risk-Adjusted Calculations Methodology
```python
# Sharpe Ratio Adjustment Factor
volatility_adjustment = 0.85  # Based on 15% max drawdown target
risk_free_rate = 0.05  # 5% risk-free rate
target_volatility = 0.22  # 22% target volatility

# Expected Return Calculation
expected_return = (target_return - risk_free_rate) / target_volatility * volatility_adjustment
```
